# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

I have made a project Driver-Drowsiness-Detection system using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.



## Logic of Project
Direct interaction with the Dlib library's face detector as well as the 68 facial landmark detector is part of the project. The 68 facial landmark detector, which identifies the locations on the human face that indicate whether the eyes are open or closed, is a very effective detector that has undergone extensive training.
