# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

I have made a project Driver-Drowsiness-Detection system using Dlib and OpenCV with Python as a backend language.



## Logic of Project
The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
